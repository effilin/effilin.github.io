              <h4>About Me</h4>
              <p class="abme"> 
                  I am a software engineering student. I have fun coding and love to create. 
                  I first started to code when I was a kid. I had HTML books and enjoyed making webpages.
                  Over the last couple years, I have been taking advantage of free online coding tutorials, 
                  when I have time at night. <br>
              </p>
               <p class="abme">
                  My first job was as an account manager where I worked closely with IT managers and
                  decision makers to provide technological solutions to resolve business problems. 
                  However, my goal at the time was to work with animals. I moved to a sales position 
                  at a dog daycare, then a veterinary receptionist and technician. I found out that 
                  working in the veterinary field was not for me, so I moved into the Insurance field.
                  I started as a claims adjuster, then moved to auto damage estimating, and finally
                  total loss specialist. When my husband and I started a family, I felt passionate 
                  about staying home with my kids, until they started school. Being a parent is 
                  amazing, fun, exhausting, and very fulfilling. I accomplished my goal with my kids
                  starting school this fall. I am very excited to move into software engineering. <br>
               </p>
               <p class="abme">                 
                 I absolutely love to read. I will read anything and everything but especially love fiction,
                 mythology, and fantasy. I love to hike and camp in nice weather, and snowboard in the winter.
                 I spend time gardening, going to concerts, and finding adventure with my family. <br>
